Topic : Pet's Little Steps (Pet Grooming and Caring Website)

Hello, Myself Saanvi Shinde, came up with an idea of comprehensive online resource for everything related to pet grooming and care, designed to help pet owners maintain the health, hygiene, and happiness of their beloved companions. With a wealth of practical tips, expert advice, and interactive features, our website serves as a trusted companion on your journey towards providing the best possible care for your furry friends.

Services I used in my website are as follows :-

1) Core Services :

    - The First core service is "STATIC WEB APP", it is designed to host static web content, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other client-side assets. This service to host my website because it automatically builds and deploys full stack web apps to Azure from a code repository.
  
    - The Second core service is "AZURE BLOB STORAGE", it is a cloud-based object storage service provided by Microsoft Azure. I used this service to store my files and folders which I used in website. In this I created a container and stored my files which include images, codes, text.


2) AI Services :

    - The Third service is "AZURE AI LANGUAGE SERVICE", used it for creating a Chat Bot. By using this service I created a chat bot of my own and connected it in my website so that a common FAQs can be accessed with the help of that chat bot and people can solve queries they have related grooming and caring of their pets.

Languages used to code my website :-

1) HTML
2) CSS
3) JAVASCRIPT
